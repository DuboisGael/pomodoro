## About

Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).

Four buttons:

plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
One to close the modal
Another to close the modal and start a new timer
